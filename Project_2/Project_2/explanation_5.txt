Created a new class which holds block chain info to which added new method called add_block.
It also has HashChain property which holds hash of all the blocks.

Time complexity of adding block is O(1) because we get the previous hash from last element of HashChain
property.

Space Complexity is dependent on number of blocks (n). So, it's O(n)
