I have added a set in the linked list class to keep track of distinct elements.

Once we have distinct elements for both te linked list's we compare both the sets
and get union and intersection.

Time complexity for looping through all the elements in a set is dependent on number
of elements(n) in the linked list. So, it's O(n)

Space complexity is O(n) because Set is being used and we are inserting all distinct elements of
linked list to it. If all n elements are distinct then worst case space complexity is O(n)
