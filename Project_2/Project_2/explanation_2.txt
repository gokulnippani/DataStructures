Recursion logic. Looping through all in the folders to fin matching files.

Time Complexity is O(d*n). Folders can have n number of folders in it. We have to loop through each and every folder.

We can represent folder structure as a tree where parent being the root directory. So, time complexity is also dependent on depth(d) of the tree.

Space Complexity is O(1) because we are not storing anything.
