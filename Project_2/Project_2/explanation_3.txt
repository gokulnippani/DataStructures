Dictionary is used to find the frequency. Then tuple is used to sort with frequency.
Since we need to have access to both the freq and char tuple is used here.
Space Complexity is dependent on number of elements(n). So, O(n)

The time complexity of the Huffman algorithm is O(nlogn).
Using a heap to store the weight of each tree, each iteration requires O(logn) time to determine the cheapest weight and insert the new weight.
There are O(n) iterations, one for each item where n being number of elements.
