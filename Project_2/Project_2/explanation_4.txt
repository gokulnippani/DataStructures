1. Get all users from the group.
2. If user is in list of users then return true
3. If user doesn't exist thn get all child groups for the current group.
4. Recursively check in all child group to check the existence of the user. If exist return true.

Since, given problem form a tree. Total groups that needs to be checked in O(d*w) where d is depth of
tree and w is width of tree. In each group we iterate the users. So, O(n) comprisions needs to be done
where n is number of users.
Time Complexity - O(dw) + O(n)

Space complexity O(dw)
