For this problem, I have used recursion to solve this problem. The basic idea of this problem
is to check if square of the mid element is equal to provided value. If, it is true then mid
element is square root. Else we will reduce the data size by taking right half or lest half.

Time Complexity is O(log n) where n is input value.

Space Complexity is O(n) because of call stack by recursion.
