We split the path where "/" is the delimiter. Individual elements after split will
be considered as trie node.

Time Complexity:
Insert and search costs O(n) where n is number of elements in an array after performing split

Space Complexity:
O(p * N) where N is number of nodes in Trie, p is size of array after splitting input path.
