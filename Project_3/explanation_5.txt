We recursively traverse the Trie to find the suggestions.

Time Complexity:
We need to search all possibilities from a given node it takes O(w*h) where w is width and h is
height in  a trie.

Space Complexity:
O(n) where d is depth of tree and n is total number of leafs. Since, we are returning
list of suggestions, it  depends on number of words with provided prefix.
