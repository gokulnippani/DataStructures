Create an auxiliary array with input array size and initialize it with 1
initialize int variable with 0
initialize int variable with ize of input array
run a for loop for all elements in an input array
if current element is 0, update value in output array at index 0, and increment it  by 1
if current element is 2, update value in output array at index 2, and decrement it  by 1
if 1, do nothing

Time Complexity:
Single traversal O(n), where n is number of elements

Space Complexity:
O(n). Since we are creating auxiliary array with size equal to input array.
