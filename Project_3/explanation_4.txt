Used dictionary to hold count of 0,1,2. We count it in single traversal.

After traversing, depending on the count of 0,1,2 we modify the input array.

Time Complexity:
Traversal to count takes O(n) and modifying input array takes O(n) where n is number of
elements in input array. For larger n, time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
O(1). We are not using any additional space. We use dictionary which is independent of input elements.
