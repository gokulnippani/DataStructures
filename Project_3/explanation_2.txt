For this problem, I have used recursion to solve this problem. The basic idea of this problem
is to check if mid element is equal to provided value. If, it is true then mid element
index is returned. Else we will reduce the data size by taking right half or lest half.

Time Complexity is O(log n) where n is input value.

Space Complexity is O(1) because algorithm is independent of input value.
