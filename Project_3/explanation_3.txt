Used merg sort to sort the array. Once we have sorted array, in order to have max sum maximum
number needs to be in most significant bit. So, we create two numbers such that MSB is occupied
 by highest numbers.

Time Complexity:
Sorting takes O(n log (n)) and rearranging takes O(n) where n is number of elements in input array.
So, Total complexity is O(n log (n)) + O (n) which is is equivalent to  O(n log (n)) for higher
values of n.

Space Complexity:
Sorting and arranging the elements depends on total number of input elements. O(n)
